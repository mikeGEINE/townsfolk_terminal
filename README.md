# Townsfolk Terminal

This is a web application to be used as a self-service terminal at a hotel.
Guests of the hotel will interact with the app via a touchscreen in order to check in, buy a room or get other services.

The app is developed with Rails 7 and as little as possible supplementary tech.
That means using primarily built-in Rails tools like import-maps, Hotwire, etc.

Basic feature set is:

- Check in guests with active and prepaid bookings.
- Redirect to hotel website for payment related tasks.
- Touchscreen-friendly vertical UI.

This is a WIP project.
